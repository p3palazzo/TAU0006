    Sebastiano Serlio begins his account of the orders with a description of the
    Tuscan order that associates it with the practice of rustication, implying
    that the two should be joined because both originated in Tuscany. In the
    process of investigating how this marriage came about and what it means,
    this essay traces the Renaissance interpretations of the Tuscan order from
    Vitruvius and Alberti through Scamozzi and then undertakes to discover what
    Renaissance theorists knew about the ancient use, first of the Tuscan order,
    and then of Rustication. Returning to Serlio, it suggests that his
    association of the two traditions was adapted from the practice of Giulio
    Romano, and reflects an interest in the dialectic between nature and culture
    characteristic of the second, post-classical generation of 16th-century
    designers.

    This book examines the career and publications of the French architect
    Julien-David Leroy (1724–1803) and his impact on architectural theory and
    pedagogy.  Despite not leaving any built work, Leroy is a major
    international figure of eighteenth-century architectural theory and culture.
    Considering the place that Leroy occupied in various intellectual circles of
    the Enlightenment and Revolutionary period, this book examines the sources
    for his ideas about architectural history and theory and defines his impact
    on subsequent architectural thought. This book will be of key interest to
    graduate students and scholars of Enlightenment-era architectural history.

    The Central Cattle Pattern (CCP) is the dominant model to interpret the Iron
    Age of southern Africa. Protagonists of the CCP argue that the model can be
    traced back to the Early Iron Age, when the first farmers settled in the
    region. In this paper, I suggest that the spatial features of the CCP are
    not diagnostic, and not restricted to patrilineal, Eastern Bantu-language
    speakers. The spatial features addressed include hut shape and village
    layout, centrally positioned livestock kraals, storage pits and burial data.
    The spatial features of the CCP, when applied to Early and Middle Iron Age
    sites, are inappropriate and mimicked by other cultures.

    The building industry's organization has been relatively invariant down
    through history due to housing's unique characteristics: durability, fixity
    in location, complex co-ordination of various trades on site and financing
    its great costs. That organizational form has allowed speculative
    development to flourish periodically during large increases in urban
    population, despite considerable risk. The same building and speculative
    processes occurred in ancient Rome and cities in England and the US at
    greatly different periods of time but those histories do not acknowledge the
    similarities of development processes that each reports. A separate 'housing
    literature' that steps back from particulars possibly explains why these
    accounts are so alike.

    While many studies have addressed the issue of proportions in the work of
    Palladio, both in the orders and in the forms and dimensions of
    architecture, very little interest has been shown in Vincenzo Scamozzi’s
    handling of this theme. This article examines Scamozzi’s influential
    published commentary regarding the proportions of the orders, rooms, and
    entire buildings, and draws numerous comparisons with Palladio. It
    interprets Scamozzi as a bridge linking the Renaissance with Enlightenment
    thinking.

    The provision of adequate quality housing for the mass population has always
    been the major challenge for a rapidly developing country like Malaysia. As
    the country heads towards higher level of urbanization, it is expected to
    face accelerated demand on housing and the associated environmental impacts.
    Only by encouraging the development of more eficient buildings or through
    implementing a holistic construction approach that addressed right from the
    onset of the design stage, harmful environmental impact to the surroundings
    can be mitigated. This paper highlights the potential of applying lexibility
    – a design approach which has been widely adopted in the traditional
    construction – as an inherent design strategy for the modern urban mass
    housing. The proposed design strategy entails open plan that enable retroit
    and reconiguration to be made quickly, economically, and repeatedly, without
    involving excessive site labour, time, and cost; as compared to the
    currently adopted design strategy which is associated with rigid structure,
    interlocking plan, and predetermined function. It makes possible the
    creation of dwellings which may grow old yet without becoming obsolete;
    incorporating the latest design ideas and technologies, yet have a sense of
    history on the Malaysian housing design (the rumah kampung design); allowing
    the communities to live for generations, yet incorporating the potential of
    adaptation. By examining the background research and the fundamental design
    principles, the paper suggests that only dwellings with high degree of
    lexibility may enable the integration of dual aims and principles of
    affordability and sustainability in mass housing, thereby facilitating the
    movement of the country’s construction industry towards mechanization,
    industrialization, and standardization.

  abstract: >-
    An examination of the cultural landscape preceding the official birth of
    iconology provides a rich and varied picture in which diverse critical
    tendencies merge and diverge. Even today, the exchange of ideas during this
    period can provide useful insights to help clarify the discussion of
    critical theory. The work of Jan Białostocki, which reflects the Polish
    scholar's open-mindedness, breadth of interests, and attention to the
    necessity of reconsidering perspectives in terms of contemporary art, offers
    an interpretation of iconology in which the contradictions between iconology
    and formalism, as developed by Panofsky, are absent. Moreover, Białostocki's
    interpretation of iconology furnishes an opportunity to consider several
    themes of the iconographic method in relation to formal problems, without
    confusion and freed from extraneous polemics. /// Une étude du paysage
    culturel avant la naissance de l'iconologie fait apparaître un tableau
    coloré aux multiples facettes, dans lequel les différents courants de la
    critique se rassemblent -- et divergent. Même aujourd'hui l'échange d'idées
    qui s'est produit à cette époque peut fournir des aperçus utiles pour aider
    à éclairer la discussion sur les théories critiques. L'oeuvre de Jan
    Białostocki reflète l'ouverture d'esprit de l'universitaire polonais, le
    large champ de ses intérêts et le soin nouveau qu'il a mis à choisir ses
    perspectives du point de vue de l'art contemporain. Il propose une
    interprétation de l'iconologie dans laquelle disparaissent les
    contradictions soulignées par Panofsky entre iconologie et formalisme. Plus
    encore, l'interprétation que Białostocki donne de l'iconologie permet de
    mettre différents thèmes de la méthode iconographique en relation avec des
    problèmes formels sans tomber dans la confusion et les polémiques étrangères
    au sujet. /// Eine Untersuchung der kulturellen Landschaft vor der
    Entstehung der Ikonologie liefert uns ein facettenreiches, buntes Bild,
    wobei unterschiedliche kritische Strömungen verschmelzen und
    auseinanderlaufen. Noch heute kann der Austausch von Ideen dieser Periode
    nützliche Einsichten bei der Klärung der Diskussion der kritischen Theorie
    liefern. Białostockis Werk reflektiert seine Aufgeschlossenheit, sein
    breites Interesse und seine Einsicht gegenüber der Notwendigkeit,
    Perspektiven vom Standpunkt der Gegenwartskunst neu zu überdenken. Seine
    Interpretation von Ikonologie weist nicht die bei Panofsky entwickelten
    Widersprüche zwischen Ikonologie und Formalismus auf. Außerdem ermöglicht
    uns Białostockis Interpretation von Ikonologie mehrere Themen der
    ikonographischen Methode im Hinblick auf formale Probleme in Ruhe und frei
    von fremder Polemik zu betrachten.

    The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in France were an epoch of
    spectacular artistic activity, exemplified by the châteaux of the Loire
    valley, the palace of Versailles, the paintings of Poussin and Claude, and
    the sculpture of Coysevox, which echo the political and cultural importance
    of France and the "Sun King". Anthony Blunt presents major artists and their
    principal works chronologically, provides an overview of the main projects
    of the period and of the artistic personalities behind them, and clearly
    sets the historical context.

    In recent years, our inherited architectural culture, which privileges the
    autonomy of form and the paradigmatic status of the western tradition, has
    been contested from a range of critical perspectives. In this article I
    address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today
    and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching
    survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less
    Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural
    difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into
    incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of
    architecture without reducing architecture to politics?

  abstract: >-
    On the definitive return of the pope to Rome in 1420, following the
    so-called Avignonese captivity, the city underwent major modifications. The
    ‘romanam curiam sequentes’, the court and administration that followed the
    traditionally itinerant pope, settled in the city, leading to Rome's
    population doubling in the space of a few years. Furthermore, with the
    support of the pope, the members of the curia came to take possession of
    spaces, offices, roles and rituals that had previously been the reserve of
    the local Romans. This article considers the reaction of the community of
    the local nobility (here described summarily as Roman families) to the
    encroaching presence of the curia within the specific context of the
    development of the built form of the via Papalis. It is argued that the via
    Papalis, one of the most important and prestigious streets in Rome, became
    the theatre within which these two communities played out their conflict
    through the medium of built and ephemeral architecture.

    This paper examines the motif of the dance as an affective moment in
    Ambrogio Lorenzetti's frescoes for the Sala dei Nove, in Siena's Palazzo
    Pubblico. The remarkable insect imagery of the dancers' dresses is shown to
    relate to a late medieval current of naturalism, and the masked dance is
    revealed in this context as a metaphor for generation. The paper argues that
    Ambrogio's dancers, through their appeal to the viewer's subjective
    experience, mask a youthful vitality, which may be taken as a measure of the
    desire for commonwealth, not just as a political abstraction but also as a
    living reality.

    Michelangelo and his younger contemporary Rosso Fiorentino were formed
    within an artistic culture that grappled with a tension between two
    modalities of the image: on one hand, as manifestation of divine authority
    and authentic object of devotion and, on the other, as emotionally affecting
    and illusory simulation of presence-including divine presence-created by
    human virtuosity. The notion of the "divine" artist became attached to
    Michelangelo in particular, and Rosso and others reacted in certain works
    that questioned the legitimacy of his enterprise. This critique,
    internalized in turn by Michelangelo himself, determined the transgressive
    character of his later monumental works.

    Questo volume si occupa di codificare il metodo per l'esecuzione di
    operazioni di lettura delle strutture edilizie che si sono costituite in
    passato a livello di "coscienza spontanea" in una progressione di grandezze
    scalari che vanno dall'edificio, all'aggregazione di edifici, all'organismo
    urbano, al territorio. L'attenzione ai prodotti architettonici del passato è
    il campo della "tipologia processuale" che è la chiave per l'utilizzazione
    della storia nell'operare come architetti nel mondo contemporaneo.

    Annotation The discipline of architecture depends on the transmission in
    space and time of accumulated experiences, concepts, rules, and models. From
    the invention of the alphabet to the development of ASCII code for
    electronic communication, the process of recording and transmitting this
    body of knowledge has reflected the dominant information technologies of
    each period. In this book Mario Carpo discusses the communications media
    used by Western architects, from classical antiquity to modern classicism,
    showing how each medium related to specific forms of architectural thinking.
    Carpo highlights the significance of the invention of movable type and
    mechanically reproduced images. He argues that Renaissance architectural
    theory, particularly the system of the five architectural orders, was
    consciously developed in response to the formats and potential of the new
    printed media. Carpo contrasts architecture in the age of printing with what
    preceded it: Vitruvian theory and the manuscript format, oral transmission
    in the Middle Ages, and the fifteenth-century transition from script to
    print. He also suggests that the basic principles of "typographic"
    architecture thrived in the Western world as long as print remained our main
    information technology. The shift from printed to digital representations,
    he points out, will again alter the course of architecture.

    The reading Jones gave to the books he owned could serve him in various
    ways. This article is concerned with one such use he made of the materials
    in the Vite by Giorgio Vasari, one volume of which we know he possessed and
    on which he made notes. It is suggested that this text gave him an
    opportunity to construct a critical vocabulary for architecture, different
    in character from that available to him from such sources as Palladio,
    Vitruvius, or Serlio. And it is also suggested that this new vocabulary is
    specifically reflected in two passages about architecture, and in what J. A.
    Gotch called Jones' sentiments about architecture, written in the notebook
    now at Chatsworth. In addition, this article is concerned with the
    development of a more general vocabulary in England in the seventeenth
    century, for gentlemen and architects alike, that came from the tradition of
    praise, or epideixis, together with terms of a more particular kind to refer
    to the parts of architecture that came both from Italian and French.

    Le centenaire de la naissance de Muratori (1910-1973) a été l’occasion de
    mieux comprendre comment l’un des initiateurs de la morphologie urbaine
    concevait la ville. Revenant aux sources qui ont guidés ses propres
    recherches sur « la ville comme seul modèle », en liaison avec Philippe
    Panerai, l’auteur fait un double point sur la carrière de Muratori. Il
    montre sa participation aux chantiers INA-Casa à Rome et son échec pour le
    quartier neuf des Barene di San Giuliano, face à Venise, qui sert de modèle
    (1949-1959). Puis il généralise ses conceptions en faisant appel à un
    demi-siècle pendant lequel l’école muratorienne a prouvé ses capacités
    d’intelligence de la ville et du territoire. Quatre éléments fondateurs
    charpentent les objectifs de Muratori : le type comme concept actif ou
    l’adaptation graduelle de la ville ; la série des échelles ; la storia
    operante ; le tissu banal de la ville.

    Este trabalho trata de duas praças - Place des Vosges, em Paris e Covent
    Garden, em Londres - consideradas modelares na história do urbanismo. Essas
    praças foram produzidas no período inicial das intervenções urbanas das
    monarquias francesa e inglesa nas suas capitais, no século XVII. A
    bibliografia e a documentação pertinentes à história inicial da Place des
    Vosges e de Covent Garden são retomadas e analisadas com o objetivo de
    identificar as diretrizes dos seus projetos, esclarecer como vieram a ser
    construídas e destacar as contribuições de alguns agentes envolvidos na sua
    elaboração e construção. No caso da Place des Vosges, a construção foi
    gradativa, marcada pelos conflitos entre vários agentes, sem que tivesse
    existido um projeto mais bem definido de uma place royale pela Coroa. No
    caso de Covent Garden, a Coroa inglesa impôs de início o projeto de uma
    place royale, mas a resistência do Conde de Bedford impediu sua realização.
    Procura-se tratar o período inicial do século XVII como uma fase específica
    da evolução urbana de Paris e de Londres vinculada à organização de duas
    formas distintas de monarquias modernas na França e na Inglaterra.

    A periodização que nos balizou situa-se entre um certo élan de modernidade

    cultural e artística que caracterizou o reinado de D. João III (a arte de
    Gregório

    Lopes, por exemplo) e os anos de regência de D. Catarina em que o
    italianismo

    se acentua, até aos alvores do domínio filipino, durante o qual a produção

    pictórica evoluiria para uma pittura senza tempo, pautada pelos rigores do
    decoro

    tridentino.

    Ao estabelecer rupturas com os paradigmas tradicionais, Francisco de

    Campos foi capaz de se libertar dos estiolantes constrangimentos que
    impunham

    limitações aos artistas da geração anterior, gerando uma obra que assumiu um

    papel de referência no contexto do Maneirismo internacional. A sua pintura

    participa da essência maneirista dominante na Europa, demarcando-se do

    mimetismo formal que caracterizava os artistas coetâneos nacionais,
    revelando

    uma total compreensão do fenómeno criativo que o mesmo supõe e produzindo

    uma obra tão original quanto moderna, que faz eco da dimensão sócio-cultural
    de

    um tempo de mudança. Nela se pressente uma agitação íntima, que a perpassa

    como um murmúreo, numa busca permanente de uma ideia de beleza universal

    que lhe confere o sentido de “graça”, parecendo dar resposta à sua
    necessidade

    formal de resolver a contradição íntima entre o sentimento lírico pessoal,
    que

    procura na forma uma comunhão sensível, e a distância própria que impõe a

    imagem litúrgica, de acordo com a tradição flamenga, da qual ele é herdeiro.
    Ora

    o virtuosismo de Campos - como vemos na belíssima Epifania da Sé de Évora -

    consiste precisamente em encontrar também no mundo litúrgico matéria de

    lirismo pessoal, implicando as suas figuras a tomada de consciência de uma

    realidade mais natural e humana, que interpela a sensibilidade pessoal do
    espectador.

    "Architectural Temperance examines relations between Bourbon Spain and papal
    Rome (1700-1759) through the lens of cultural politics. With a focus on key
    Spanish architects sent to study in Rome by the Bourbon Kings, the book also
    discusses the establishment of a program of architectural education at the
    newly founded Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.
    Victor Deupi explores why a powerful nation like Spain would temper its own
    building traditions with the more cosmopolitan trends associated with Rome;
    often at the expense of its own national and regional traditions. Through
    the inclusion of previously unpublished documents and images that shed light
    on the theoretical debates which shaped eighteenth-century architecture in
    Rome and Madrid, Architectural Temperance provides an insight into 18th
    century Spanish architecture in English"--

    Este trabalho pretende ser um estudo preliminar sobre a caracterização da
    paleta de Diogo de Torres, pintor maneirista, cujas pinturas forma
    intervencionadas recentemente. Para tal foram analisados os materiais
    constituintes das camadas cromáticas, presentes nas quatro pinturas
    retabulares do século XVI de Diogo de Torres Vedras e expostas na Igreja de
    S. Pedro em Dois Portos, bem como a sua técnica artística. Verificou-se a
    existência de uma preparação à base de gesso e a utilização de pigmentos
    comuns à época, como o branco de chumbo, goetite, terra de sombra,
    vermelhão, mínio, azurite, azul de esmalte, carvão e corante vermelho
    cochonilha nas quatro pinturas, através da análise por microscopia óptica,
    μ-EDXRF, μ-Raman, μ-FTIR, HPLC-DAD e μ-EDX-SEM. Foi identificado por μ-FTIR,
    a presença de aglutinante oleoso em todos os estratos analisados.

    Foi ainda iniciado um projecto para o estudo da descoloração do azul
    esmalte, um dos pigmentos utilizados pelo artista. Este estudo teve como
    motivação a descoloração total das partículas de azul de esmalte, observada
    em todas as amostras analisadas das pinturas de Diogo de Torres. Com o
    intuito de compreender qual ou quais as causas e tendo presente dois
    factores que podem afectar a descoloração das partículas, a humidade
    relativa e o envelhecimento do óleo, estas amostras reais do séc. XVI foram
    analisadas por microscopia óptica, EDX-SEM e μ-FTIR e comparadas com
    amostras sintetizadas e reconstruções de camadas cromáticas de composição
    semelhante. A exposição durante quatro meses a 80% de humidade relativa das
    reconstruções cromáticas não revelou degradação do pigmento, apresentando
    apenas, por exame de colorímetria, alteração da cor nas superfícies para
    valores mais amarelos, originados pelo óleo. Foi ainda analisado o pigmento
    antes e após ensaios de imersão, verificando-se uma variação de pH
    consistente com a sua degradação.

    "Interactions between the visual arts and the theatre are not simply a
    matter of exchanges of media or genres. They affect the way a play, painting
    or statue is viewed, the media, genres and arts involved, and the characters
    on stage or represented in painting or sculpture. These interactions raise
    questions about the ways genres are distinguished and defined, and
    ultimately the relation between representation and presence. This book
    offers the first systematic investigation of exchanges between the arts,
    architecture and the theatre, and not just an overview of the influence of
    the theatre on the arts, and vice versa. The authors take as their starting
    point a study of the implications of the use of four elements that define
    early modern theatre: the scenario, the actor, the theatrical space, and the
    audience. In doing so, the authors open up new ways of analyzing
    theatricality both in the arts, architecture and the theatre. They also
    present many new, hitherto unknown instances of the interaction between the
    arts, and provide these interactions with a theoretical and
    historiographical context"--

    Malaysian plural society is characterized by a concentration of Chinese in
    urban and a concentration of Malays in rural areas. So far, economic and
    political factors have been emphasized to explain the spatial
    differentiation of these communities. Though the importance of these factors
    is recognized a cultural dimension is added and its impact analyzed. It is
    argued that Malays and Chinese differ in their cultural values concerning
    space. Whereas the Malay conception of space is centrifocal, the Chinese
    conception of space is bounded. The consistency of this cultural pattern is
    demonstrated by drawing examples from conceptions of geographical, social,
    religious and political space and their combination in an image of the city.
    As Malaysian towns and housing developments are built according to a Chinese
    conception of space, the absorption of Malay rural-urban migrants is impeded
    and Chinese Control over urban commercial activities is maintained. Es ist
    nicht das Bewusstsein der Menschen, das ihr Sein, sondern umgekehrt ihr
    gesellschaftliches Sein, das ihr Bewusstsein bestimmt.

    During the time when the Ethiopian kings were based in the city of Gondär
    (c. 1636–1769), they erected a series of stone-and-mortar buildings
    (‘castles’ or ‘palaces’) of semi-military style, which are nowadays one of
    the main tourist attractions of the country and have intrigued scholars ever
    since their first description by the Scottish traveler James Bruce in 1790.
    Recent studies have tended to reject the importance attributed by
    traditional scholarship—heavily influenced by colonial prejudices—to the
    influence of Portuguese and Jesuit presence in the country all through the
    previous decades and have instead looked for a mainly Oriental origin
    (Ottoman, Indian, etc.) of the architecture. After the
    archaeological/architectural survey and excavations at several of the main
    Jesuit sites by a team led by the Universidad Complutense de Madrid
    (2006–2014), there seems to be enough reasons to take the important
    buildings made by the Jesuit missionaries and technicians, between 1621 and
    1632, as one of the main sources of the subsequent Gondärine architecture.

  abstract: >-
    Public spaces have been long recognized as integral parts of urban settings,
    often granted importance by the public ceremonies and spectacles that they
    hosted. Interpretations of such public arenas often focus on elites that use
    them to construct and legitimize power and authority; city residents are
    thought to either accept these political machinations, or reject them and
    the space itself. Alternately, studies of public space that emphasize more
    practical uses, such as for production or other domestic activities tend to
    focus on those spaces directly associated with houses, emphasizing the
    everyday life of city residents. This paper works to set aside this
    dichotomy by exploring the multi-faceted open spaces at Songo Mnara, a
    medieval Swahili town on the southern Tanzanian coast. Songo Mnara is
    particularly well-suited to a study of Swahili public space because of its
    short occupation and clear town plan understood through standing
    architecture; it is likely the best example of how the southern Swahili
    understood a planned town should be organized in the fifteenth century AD.
    Archaeological research directed at the site’s open spaces has revealed a
    variety of public spaces which include a mix of deliberately-maintained
    areas reflecting some element of control and planning, and other less formal
    public spaces that seem to have been organized and maintained by non-elite
    residents of the town. This essay reviews literature on the archaeology of
    open and public space and explores how the case of Songo Mnara contributes
    to it, by walking the reader through what has been learned about the complex
    and variable public spaces of the town. The public spaces of Songo Mnara
    serve to broaden previous dichotomous approaches to urban open space.

    Fu Xinian is considered by many to be the world's leading historian of
    Chinese architecture. He is an expert on every type of Chinese architecture
    from every period through the nineteenth century, and his work is at the
    cutting edge of the field. This wide-ranging book gathers together, for the
    first time in English, twelve seminal essays by Fu Xinian. It pays special
    attention to the technical aspects of the building tradition since the first
    millennium BC, and Fu Xinian's signature drawings abundantly illustrate its
    nuances. The essays delve into the modular basis for individual structures,
    complexes, and cities; lateral and longitudinal building frames; the unity
    of sculpture and building to create viewing angles; the influence of Chinese
    construction on Japanese architecture; and the reliability of images to
    inform us about architecture. Organized chronologically, the book also
    examines such topics as the representation of architecture on vessels in the
    Warring States period, early Buddhist architecture, and the evolution of
    imperial architecture from the Tang to Ming dynasty. A biography of Fu
    Xinian and a detailed Chinese-English glossary are included. Bringing
    together some of the most groundbreaking scholarship in Chinese
    architectural history, it showcases an uncontested master of the discipline.

    One of the most important characteristics of Chinese traditional
    architecture is the arrangement of buildings around courtyards. The
    courtyard as a fundamental feature of Chinese space goes hand-in-hand with
    the basic tenet of spatial growth: architecture, and thus courtyards, unfold
    on the horizontal plane; with the exception of Buddhist pagodas, vertical
    projection is rare in Chinese architecture. Palaces, monasteries, and
    vernacular construction consist of individual buildings that enclose one or
    more courtyards of varying dimensions in response to function. Even if a
    seemingly endless number of courtyards with a variety of buildings and
    spatial designs unfolds, hierarchy of buildings and

    L’an VIII de la République, l’architecte Charles François Viel (1745-1819),
    constructeur chevronné et théoricien signataire de nombreux pamphlets1,
    publiait une brochure à l’intitulé provocateur, Décadence de l’architecture
    à la fin du xviiie siècle2. Cette formule alarmiste et percutante, comme les
    affectionnait l’auteur, est emblématique du combat récurrent, qui motive
    toute son œuvre publiée, contre la dissociation de la triade, solidité,
    convenance, beauté, qui fondait la théorie de l’architecture depuis la
    Renaissance. Les titres des deux livres suivants, De l'impuissance des
    mathématiques pour assurer la solidité des bâtimens (1805)3, puis, De la
    solidité des bâtimens, puisée dans les proportions des ordres d'architecture
    (1806)4, font aujourd’hui figure de pure provocation, tant il est vrai que
    nous regardons comme une évidence que l’art de bâtir relève des techniques
    et des sciences de l’ingénieur et qu’il repose sur une connaissance
    expérimentale de la résistance des matériaux et sur des modèles
    mathématiques qui permettent de calculer la capacité des structures, non sur
    une maîtrise exemplaire du vocabulaire classique et du système des ordres.
    Pour autant, l’engagement réactionnaire de celui qui fut l’un des bâtisseurs
    les plus reconnus de son temps témoigne bien de la fin d’une époque. Elle
    s’oppose à l’instauration d’une approche autonome de la question de la
    solidité, fondée sur une compétence spécifique et qui coïncide avec
    l’émergence de la figure de l’ingénieu [...]

  abstract: "First director of the Académie royale d’architecture, François Blondel established a lasting model for architectural education that helped transform a still largely medieval profession into the one we recognize today.   Most well known for his 1676 urban plan of Paris, Blondel is also celebrated as a mathematician, scientist, and scholar. Few figures are more representative of the close affinity between architecture and the \"new science\" of the seventeenth century.   The first full-length study in English to appear on this polymath, this book adds to the scholarship on early modern architectural history and particularly on French classicism under Louis XIV and his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. It studies early modern science and technology, Baroque court culture, and\_the development of the discipline of architecture."

    A large number of random studies on traditional Islamic cities have been
    published over the past two decades. This paper suggests 15 studies which
    need to be thoroughly researched and published to add to our current
    knowledge base on this subject. Once this material is available, it would be
    feasible to construct a comprehensive theory of urban form in traditional
    Islamic cities, which currently does not exist.

    Vernacular Architecture in the Pre-Columbian Americas reveals the dynamism
    of the ancient past, where social relations and long-term history were
    created posthole by posthole, brick by brick. This collection shifts
    attention away from the elite and monumental architectural traditions of the
    region to instead investigate the creativity, subtlety and variability of
    common architecture and the people who built and dwelled in them. At the
    heart of this study of vernacular architecture is an emphasis on ordinary
    people and their built environments, and how these everyday spaces were
    pivotal in the making and meaning of social and cultural dynamics. Providing
    a deeper and more nuanced temporal perspective of common buildings in the
    Americas, the editors have deftly framed a study that highlights
    sociocultural diversity while at the same time facilitating broader
    comparative conversations around the theme of vernacular architecture. With
    diverse case studies covering a broad range of periods and regions,
    Vernacular Architecture in the Pre-Columbian Americas is an important
    addition to the growing body of scholarship on the indigenous architecture
    of the Americas and is a key contribution to our archaeological
    understandings of past built environments.

    "Embracing a thousand years of history and an area stretching from the
    Atlantic to the borders of India and China, Robert Hillenbrand - a world
    authority on Islamic art and architecture - has written an unrivalled new
    synthesis of the arts of Islamic civilization. From the death of the Prophet
    Muhammad to the survival of the Ottoman empire well into the modern age,
    Hillenbrand traces the evolution of an extraordinary range of art forms,
    including architecture, calligraphy, book illumination, painting, ceramics,
    glassware, textiles and metalwork. Complete with maps and glossary, this is
    an accessible and definitive guide to the arts of a vastly accomplished
    civilization."--Jacket.

    Stratified societies in southern Africa first developed in the
    Shashe–Limpopo Basin. As is well known, rank-based society at K2 developed
    into class distinction at Mapungubwe. The transfer of this new social
    organisation to Great Zimbabwe has received less attention. New research on
    rainmaking practices suggests that a Mapungubwe dynasty introduced class
    structures at Great Zimbabwe. Poor climatic conditions at the end of the
    13th century undermined sacred leaders at Mapungubwe itself, and while
    vulnerable, the elite at Great Zimbabwe took over the important gold and
    ivory trade. Among other things, the new elite used the unique Zimbabwe
    birdstones to establish their legitimacy.

    Because extensive European acquaintance with the African interior dates only
    to the nineteenth century, it is often assumed that this is territory
    without a history. Indeed, earlier written documents are far rarer here than
    in many other parts of the world. Nonetheless, we know that even when
    Portuguese sailors first arrived on the African coasts in the fifteenth
    century, the borders of the territories occupied by various peoples were
    fluid and often disputed. Only when Africa was colonized by Europeans, a
    process that began in the fifteenth century and culminated in the Italian
    conquest of Ethiopia in the 1930s, were

  abstract: >-
    In eighteenth-century France, the influential architect and historian
    Julien-David Leroy studied ancient monuments through two different
    methods-what he called the "historical" and the "architectural." These two
    approaches had distinctly different intended audiences, methods, and goals.
    His historical method was a traditional humanistic approach to the ancient
    monuments that studied a building's architecture in relation to its specific
    historic context. His architectural method, consistent with scientific
    practice, considered the relations among numerous similar monuments as a
    means of revealing underlying universal laws. In the eighteenth century,
    history and science both promised enlightenment, but the exact shape of that
    new knowledge and its implications for the present varied tremendously.
    Through a comparative analysis of his two methods, and of their development,
    interaction, and significance, this paper assesses the exact shape of
    Leroy's dualistic thought, and its implications for architectural practice,
    history and theory.

    This translation uses the text of the original 1753 edition. It also
    includes additions made by Laugier for the edition of 1755 as well as the
    Avertissement for that edition, which contains Laugier's rebuttal to his
    critics. An introduction by Wolfgang Herrmann gives details of Laugier's
    life and the context in which this book was written. The Essai is important
    as a key document in 18th century art theory. It is invaluable for a
    thorough understanding of the Neoclassical aesthetic and its development
    from the rationalism of the Enlightenment.

    In 1614 Padovanino, a virtually unknown artist, arrived in Rome, where he
    copied Titian's Bacchanals in the Aldobrandini collection. At about the same
    time the celebrated painter Domenichino did the same. In that year
    Domenichino also unveiled The Last Communion of Saint Jerome, which was
    clearly a repetition of an earlier work by his master, Agostino Carracci.
    Although Giovanni Lanfranco, Domenichino's rival, dismissed the painting as
    a theft, the larger Roman art community did not quite agree. This paper
    examines artistic influence and production in an age before anxiety and
    outlines an aesthetic of repetition in an age before originality.

    The Majapahit Empire was a Javanese Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empire in
    Southeast Asia, based on the island of Java (part of modern-day Indonesia),
    that existed from 1293 to circa 1517. Majapahit reached its peak of glory
    during the era of Hayam Wuruk, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 was marked by
    conquest which extended through Southeast Asia. His achievement is also
    credited to his prime minister, Gajah Mada. According to the Nagarakretagama
    (Desawarñana) written in 1365, Majapahit was an empire of 98 tributaries,
    stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea; consisting of present-day Indonesia,
    Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, southern Thailand, East Timor, Sulu Archipelago
    and other parts of the Philippines, although the true nature of Majapahit
    sphere of influence is still the subject of studies among
    historians.Majapahit was one of the last major Hindu empires of the region
    and is considered to be one of the greatest and most powerful empires in the
    history of Indonesia and Southeast Asia, one that is sometimes seen as the
    precedent for Indonesia's modern boundaries. Its influence extended beyond
    the modern territory of Indonesia and has been the subject of many studies.

    The Malacca Sultanate (Malay: Kesultanan Melayu Melaka; Jawi script: کسلطانن
    ملايو ملاک) was a Malay sultanate centred in the modern-day state of
    Malacca, Malaysia. Conventional historical thesis marks c. 1400 as the
    founding year of the sultanate by a Malay Raja of Singapura (King of
    Singapore), Parameswara, also known as Iskandar Shah. 

    At the height of the sultanate's power in the 15th century, its capital grew
    into one of the most important entrepôts of its time, with territory
    covering much of the Malay Peninsula, the Riau Islands and a significant
    portion of the northern coast of Sumatra in present-day Indonesia.As a
    bustling international trading port, Malacca emerged as a centre for Islamic
    learning and dissemination, and encouraged the development of the Malay
    language, literature and arts. It heralded the golden age of Malay
    sultanates in the archipelago, in which Classical Malay became the lingua
    franca of the Maritime Southeast Asia and Jawi script became the primary
    medium for cultural, religious and intellectual exchange. It is through
    these intellectual, spiritual and cultural developments, the Malaccan era
    witnessed the enculturation of a Malay identity, the Malayisation of the
    region and the subsequent formation of an Alam Melayu.In the year of 1511,
    the capital of Malacca fell to the Portuguese Empire, forcing the last
    Sultan, Mahmud Shah (r. 1488–1511), to retreat to the further reaches of his
    empire, where his progeny established new ruling dynasties, Johor and Perak.
    The political and cultural legacy of the sultanate remains to this day. For
    centuries, Malacca has been held up as an exemplar of Malay-Muslim
    civilisation. It established systems of trade, diplomacy, and governance
    that persisted well into the 19th century, and introduced concepts such as
    daulat – a distinctly Malay notion of sovereignty – that continues to shape
    contemporary understanding of Malay kingship. The fall of Malacca benefited
    Brunei when its ports became a new entrepôt as the kingdom emerged as a new
    Muslim empire in the Malay Archipelago, attracting many Muslim traders who
    fled from the Portuguese occupation after the ruler of Brunei's conversion
    to Islam.

    In the past few decades, community resilience has become a critical topic
    gaining increasing academic and programmatic attention (Skerratt, 2013;
    Skerratt and Steiner, 2013; Steiner and Markantoni, 2014). The departure
    from the ‘predict and prevent’ model (IFRC, 2012) in development discourse
    has led to attention given to uncertain disruptions that may impact
    communities. Concurrently, human settlements around the world are evolving
    in response to changing development trajectories. Settlements have become
    more complex communities of connectivity and interdependency. However, the
    complexity is explained by the vulnerability to disruptions that can turn
    highly functional settlements into dysfunction. In Zimbabwe, human
    settlements have

  abstract: >-
    To date Rudolf Wittkower's Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism
    of 1949 remains a fundamental evaluation of Renaissance architectural
    aesthetics. Although not unique in having achieved such paradigmatic status
    within its discipline, its simultaneous impact upon architectural production
    remains unprecedented. It is precisely the fact that this work captured the
    imagination of two traditionally distinct groups at a moment in history when
    exchanges between the two seemed least likely to occur that constitutes the
    starting point for this inquiry. Based upon an examination of Principles
    against the Renaissance literature it so categorically supplanted, against
    its art historical and broader intellectual context, as well as against
    contemporary architectural theory, the argument presented here proposes a
    deeper cultural continuity between the discourse of modernist architecture
    in the 1940s and 1950s and the readings of history that were conceived at
    the same time. In conclusion it is argued that beyond affording specific
    insight into the historicity of our constructions of the Renaissance, such a
    pattern of exchange between history writing and criticism/theory alerts us
    to the complex symbiosis that existed between these two reflective
    activities at the very heart of modernism itself.

    The ongoing debate among practitioners and in academia about the meaning and
    understanding of Islamic architecture will be energized by this book. It
    contains essays by architects and academics from various parts of the world
    which clarify how the carious disciplines of the design profession can be
    employed to build in the spirit of Islam. Divided into three sections the
    book covers: *meaning from Faith, which draws meaning from the Islamic faith
    in order to propose a built environment that is universally
    beneficial*analysis of History, which examines historical buildings and
    planning concepts, and suggest how to apply lessons learned to contemporary
    practice*contemporary Trends, which discusses current trends in
    architecture, education and socio-economic aspects of various Muslim
    countries. Illustrated throughout, this book will appeal to students and
    scholars, practising architects and planners alike.

    Encore doctorant en 1998, j’ai eu le plaisir de travailler avec Monik
    Kervran sur son chantier à Sewan Shariff au Pakistan. Monik a fait partie de
    mon jury de thèse en 2001 pour sa grande connaissance du commerce dans
    l’océan Indien. Elle a notamment publié un article sur une mosquée bahrainie
    où elle trace des parallèles intéressants avec la mosquée swahilie de
    Kizimkazi à Zanzibar (Kervran et Kalus 1990:48-49). Depuis, les fouilles
    archéologiques que je mène en Afrique orientale ont permis d’ajouter de
    nouveaux éléments à notre connaissance du commerce entre l’Afrique orientale
    et les pays musulmans. Les informations présentées

  abstract: >-
    L'étude des charpentes constitue un moyen de datation de l'architecture
    rurale, du moins à l'échelle d'une région. A Genève, les maisons paysannes
    les plus anciennes présentent des charpentes à poteaux dont les pièces,
    simplement équarries, s'assemblent à mi-bois et à queue d'aronde. Les
    charpentes à structures triangulées (fermes et pannes) se diffusent au cours
    du XVIIIe siècle, tandis que les assemblages s'effectuent de plus en plus
    fréquemment à tenon et mortaise. Au XIXe siècle, les structures, établies
    d’après de meilleurs calculs, relèvent d'une conception plus savante et l'on
    cherche à libérer l'espace intérieur tout en réduisant la longueur et la
    section des pièces de bois.

    Desde sua primeira edição inglesa em 1993, Entender a arquitetura tem se
    transformado em um texto de referência clássico. Este manual ilustrado
    continua sendo o único texto de seu gênero que examina a arquitetura como um
    fenômeno cultural, artístico e tecnológico por meio de um enfoque duplo: o
    temático, que aborda os elementos de arquitetura, e o histórico, que se
    centra em sua evolução temporal e seu significado. Seu texto completo,
    acessível e agradável, de caráter claro e básico, destaca-se pela seleção
    criteriosa de exemplos e por comparações perspicazes, resultando em um
    manual de altíssimo valor didático e adequado para uma introdução à
    complexidade de conceitos e orientações fundamentais ao entendimento da
    história da arquitetura.

  abstract: >-
    A parametric shape grammar of the traditional Malay houses (TMH) built in
    the past century is presented. The grammar, which consists of rules for
    generating the form and structure of TMH, is derived from simple geometric
    representations of the houses. The rules first derive the basic unit
    structures that form the shapes of the TMH. Nine basic shapes have been
    identified that form the main vocabulary elements of the grammar.
    Parameterized polygons and lines define each basic shape. Ranges of values
    assigned to the variables describing the parameterized polygons and lines
    are presented. The shape addition rules are used to characterize the
    compositional aspects of TMH style. Evidences of these basic shapes or their
    combinations have been documented by previous researchers and are used as a
    way of explaining the built forms of the TMH. The scope of the study is
    currently limited to the original TMH of the bumbung panjang (long roof)
    type in which the key features of the houses are easily discernible from the
    side view.

    This paper explores urban form and design in Japanese castle towns of the
    Edo period — the most common urban type, from which most of today's cities
    have developed. Original layouts, Feng-Tsui design principles, and more
    modern adaptations of form are explored.

    Hans Sedlmayr published two editions of Die Architektur Borrominis in 1930
    and 1939 with the second edition reprinted 1973 and 1986. We have followed
    the first edition but included the preface and essay written for the second
    edition (in 1939 replacing the original introduction) as an appendix at the
    end. In what was somewhat unusual for him, he invested his theoretical ideas
    with the substance of example in what turned out to certainly be quite a
    multi-facetted career. His most well meaning critics called for him to
    provide more concrete examples, and among other things, this book stands out
    for that reason. Among the art historians in the University of Vienna at
    that time monographic studies were also out of the ordinary.

    This illustrated book is a comprehensive and authoritative study of Chinese
    architecture from Neolithic times through the early twentieth century. Six
    of China's greatest architectural historians have joined with a leading
    Western scholar to write this book, the first in-depth, collaborative
    history of Chinese architecture in more than fifty years." "Drawing on
    recent discoveries and current scholarly work inside China, this handsome
    volume recounts the story of China's architectural achievements and the
    historical, political, cultural, and social factors that shaped them. Each
    chapter includes sections on cities, palaces, religious architecture, tombs,
    and gardens as well as discussions of bridges, walls, fortifications,
    academics, and architectural writings." "Amply enhanced with more than 300
    color photographs and exquisite drawings - many of which are reproduced here
    for the first time - and also featuring maps, charts, and an index with
    Chinese terms, the book will be an invaluable resource for scholars of China
    and everyone interested in one of the world's greatest architectural
    traditions.

  abstract: >-
    Throughout history, China has maintained one of the world's richest built
    civilizations. The nation's architectural achievements range from its
    earliest walled cities and the First Emperor's vision of city and empire, to
    bridges, pagodas, and the twentieth-century constructions of the Socialist
    state. In this beautifully illustrated book, Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt
    presents the first fully comprehensive survey of Chinese architecture in any
    language. With rich political and historical context, Steinhardt covers
    forty centuries of architecture, from the genesis of Chinese building
    through to the twenty-first century and the challenges of urban expansion
    and globalism. Steinhardt follows the extraordinary breadth of China's
    architectural legacy--including excavation sites, gardens, guild halls, and
    relief sculpture--and considers the influence of Chinese architecture on
    Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Tibet. Architectural examples from Chinese
    ethnic populations and various religions are examined, such as monasteries,
    mosques, observatories, and tombs. Steinhardt also shows that Chinese
    architecture is united by a standardized system of construction, applicable
    whether buildings are temples, imperial palaces, or shrines. Every
    architectural type is based on the models that came before it, and
    principles established centuries earlier dictate building practices. China's
    unique system has allowed its built environment to stand as a profound
    symbol of Chinese culture

  abstract: >-
    Construction of the Cathedral or Duomo of S. Maria del Fiore began in
    Florence in 1293/94, reached the stage of rising masonry by 1296, and had
    progressed so well by 1300 that the Florentine city council authorized a
    lifetime tax exemption for its founding architect, Arnolfo di Cambio. But at
    some moment after this auspicious start ill-fortune intervened: by 1310
    Arnolfo was dead and work on his project suspended. Refounded as a new
    project in a series of committee decisions in the years 1357-1368, Florence
    Cathedral is generally regarded as anonymous or collective in authorship.
    Its fame rests not on Arnolfo's abandoned and unrecorded project but on the
    prodigious cupola erected by Filippo Brunelleschi from 1420 to 1436,
    Europe's first major dome since antiquity and chief harbinger of the Italian
    Renaissance. In 1978 the author presented excavation results that questioned
    the Brunelleschi-centered tradition and reinforced instead a persistent
    counter-tradition which attributes the basic features of the 1368 plan and
    of Brunelleschi's cupola to Arnolfo's original project of ca. 1293-1296.
    That preliminary hypothesis in favor of Arnolfo as conceptual author of
    Florence Cathedral is now strengthened by the results of a second Duomo
    excavation in 1980. The new findings, together with a reappraisal of the
    documentary evidence and a set of reconstruction drawings, are submitted
    here as a second and longer look at the project that changed the course of
    European architecture.

  abstract: >-
    Since Alberti, and most critically since Wittkower’s Architectural
    Principles, architectural theory has tended to construe ‘proportions’ in
    plenary, static terms. The dimension of time and change that relentlessly
    affects all human endeavor is not accommodated by the celebrated Albertian
    ideal of immutable design perfection, so perfect in all respects that once
    attained ‘nothing can be added, taken away, or altered, but for the worse’.
    This article, drawing on the author’s recent book, Building-in-Time from
    Giotto to Alberti and Modern Oblivion (Yale, 2010), outlines the
    antithetical, dynamic proportional methodology of the pre-Albertian
    architectural regime. Its point of departure was the author’s concept of
    durational aesthetics, according to which perfected architectural form is
    produced by a process of incessant revision. What distinguished this process
    from related ancient or neo-antique doctrines was above all its dynamic
    modality and participation in the fluid orientation and processes of
    ‘building-in-time’.

  abstract: >-
    Despite Alberti's well-known doubts about the usefulness of Vitruvius as a
    guide for the study of architecture, most architectural historians have
    considered that the structure of De re aedificatoria is based on, or similar
    to, that of the De architectura libri decem. However, when we look closely
    at the structure of De re aedificatoria and the way in which Alberti orders
    and presents his material, Vitruvius can no longer be considered as the main
    model for Alberti. De re aedificatoria contains a number of quite precise
    statements about its structure and order of presentation. A close reading of
    these passages and a comparison with classical and medieval discussions of
    method in the liberal and productive arts show that the structure of De re
    aedificatoria is not based on that of De architectura; rather it is in line
    with classical methods of rhetoric which originated in Plato's Phaedrus and
    Aristotle's Metaphysics.

    Summary: Harmonic and Architectural Proportions in the 17th and 18th-Century
    French Theory. Architecture and music were often linked together. René
    Ouvrard, in his significant work concerning this subject, "Architecture
    harmonique, ou Application de la Doctrine des Proportions à l'Architecture"
    (Paris, 1679), attempts to prove (like Vitruv and later Alberti) that music
    works like architecture, both being based upon the same kind of fundamental
    proportions. These proportions are also proof of a divine harmony because as
    architecture, and music both follow human proportions, these arts are
    therefore imitative of the perfection given by God when He created the human
    form. The treatise of Ouvrard was also included in the "Cours
    d'architecture" of Blondel as part of the "Quarell of Ancients and
    Modernes"; the opposing view was represented by Perrault in "Parallèle". The
    theory of Ouvrard works with a rhetorical figure: the epephonical object.
    Using architecture in one way and music in the other way (it depends upon
    the first point of view), Ouvrard concludes that if these arts are to
    function in the same way, they must follow the principles edicted to them in
    Antiquity.

    The Orders, the long-time emblematic centerpiece of architectural education,
    were banished from studio in the United States a half-century ago. They were
    exiled to the curriculum's sparse offerings in history when the Bauhaus
    system of education in architecture displaced the Beaux Arts system. The
    Orders stand for an entire system of design based on recognizable building
    components, proportionality, and coherence. Their presence would improve the
    formal qualities of designs across the entire spectrum from buildings
    addressing the increased interest in traditional qualities in buildings to
    those pushing forward the legacy of Modernism's founders, men who themselves
    knew the Orders well.

  abstract: >-
    A Pequena Era Glacial (Pequena Idade do Gelo, em português Europeu) foi um
    período de resfriamento que ocorreu na Era Moderna. Os climatologistas não
    estão de acordo sobre as datas de início e fim deste período. Alguns
    defendem que teria iniciado no século XVI e terminado na primeira metade do
    século XIX, enquanto outros sugerem que foi em um período do século XIII ao
    XVII. Teria sido nos anos de 1650, 1770 e 1850 que ocorreram os mínimos de
    temperatura, cada um separado por intervalos ligeiramente mais quentes [1].
    O período mais frio da Pequena Era Glacial parece estar relacionado com uma
    profunda queda nas tempestades solares conhecida como Mínimo de Maunder. 

    Foi no século XVII, devido à Pequena Era Glacial, que os viquingues
    abandonaram a Groenlândia, cuja vegetação passou de verdejante a tundra. A
    Finlândia perdeu então um terço da sua população e a Islândia metade. Na
    Inglaterra, o Tâmisa congelou (pela primeira vez em 1607, pela última em
    1814). No inverno de 1780, a zona fluvial de Nova Iorque congelou e podia-se
    ir a pé da ilha de Manhattan à de Staten Island, tendo as conexões
    comerciais bloqueadas por via marítima. Os canais holandeses costumavam
    ficar completamente congelados. As geleiras nos Alpes cobriam aldeias
    inteiras, matando milhares de pessoas, e se formou uma grande quantidade de
    gelo no mar, a tal ponto que não existia mar aberto em torno da Islândia em
    1695.


    Alguns investigadores acreditam que o atual aquecimento do planeta
    corresponde a um período de recuperação após a Pequena Era Glacial e que a
    atividade humana não é um fator decisivo para a atual tendência de aumento
    da temperatura global. No entanto, esta tese tem oposição dos ambientalistas
    em razão da grande proporção da elevação da temperatura nas recentes décadas
    após a Revolução Industrial.

    This article examines the book culture of the Jesuit mission to Ethiopia
    (1557–1632). Combining archival and field research, it considers the
    composition of the mission’s now-lost libraries, the use of books as tools
    of conversion, book production, and missionary engagement with Ethiopian
    Orthodox book culture. Furthermore, it illuminates the Jesuit reliance upon
    Ethiopian collaborators both to understand Orthodox texts and to produce
    Catholic manuscripts in the absence of a printing press. Using the personal
    libraries of Pedro Páez, S.J. and Afonso Mendes, S.J. as case studies, it
    posits that the gradual acceleration of acts performed by Jesuits upon
    Orthodox books—including collecting, translating, editing, and
    destroying—paralleled the rising aggression and cultural intolerance of the
    mission. Ultimately, this resulted in the expulsion and murder of the
    Jesuits, and the destruction of their libraries in a series of
    state-sanctioned book burnings that permitted a revival of Ethiopian
    Orthodoxy.

    Urban communities on the medieval East African coast have been previously
    discussed in terms of ethnicity and migration. Here assemblages from coastal
    towns and from surface survey in the interior are used to paint a different
    picture of urban (Swahili) origins. The author shows that coast and interior
    shared a common culture, but that coastal sites grew into ‘stonetowns’
    thanks to the social impact of imports: the material culture structured the
    society.

    Houses are an important subject of archaeological research, normally
    explored through the households they contain. This has established a
    deliberately social agenda for the archaeology of houses, yet has had the
    unintended consequence of creating bounded worlds for study. Although
    household archaeologies explore the ways that households contributed to
    broader social and economic realms, it is rare to think through the public
    role of houses for non-residents and the larger population of the
    settlement. This paper seeks to explore this more public aspect of houses
    using the data from archaeology at Songo Mnara, a 14th–15th century Swahili
    town on the southern Tanzanian coast. This was a time when stone-built
    domestic architecture was first emerging in this region. The archaeology of
    the houses provides data for a series of ways that the house was at the
    heart of the economic and political life of the town, as well as
    demonstrating a spatial continuity between indoor and outdoor spaces. It is
    therefore suggested that the domestic and residential functions of the house
    for a particular household should be balanced with an appreciation of the
    broader world of the house itself.

    Twenty-thirteen is a sad year for the social sciences and history. With the
    death of Janet Lippman Abu-Lughod (b. 1928) last Saturday, the best of
    academic learning has suffered another blow. Her passing joins the recent
    loss of her New School colleagues Eric Hobsbawm, Aristide Zolberg and
    Charles Tilly. Each in his way enriched the historically oriented social
    study of the modern world. Among them, known for their dedication to
    intellectual excellence, as well as versatility and originality, Abu-Lughod
    distinguished herself as a very rare scholar who could range across
    centuries and continents, from the thirteenth century to the current moment,
    from the North Africa and the Middle East to Central Asia and North America.
    She was to the end a Chicago School urbanist whose methodological approach
    combined a unique ability to expand its scope into comparative studies that
    brought a needed political dimension. Upon her arrival to the New School for
    Social Research in 1987, she had already achieved a phenomenal output of
    well over a hundred articles and more than thirteen books......Read More
