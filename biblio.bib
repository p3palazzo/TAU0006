In the process of investigating how this marriage came about and what it means, this essay traces the Renaissance interpretations of the Tuscan order from Vitruvius and Alberti through Scamozzi and then undertakes to discover what Renaissance theorists knew about the ancient use, first of the Tuscan order, and then of Rustication. Returning to Serlio, it suggests that his association of the two traditions was adapted from the practice of Giulio Romano, and reflects an interest in the dialectic between nature and culture characteristic of the second, post-classical generation of 16th-century designers.},

  abstract = {The history of architecture has for long time been rather immune to any sort of internal and external criticism, that would question the ideologies of those writing it, not least in their more or less explicit commitment to design practice. This is the more surprising as not only in history, but in particular in the history of art, such a criticism, that considers the existence of different theories of history, has been established since long. The history of architecture has been written very often by architects or by committed architecture historians, excluding many unsuccessful and problematic aspects of the profession. On the backdrop of this lack of criticism, two architecture (art) historian are discussed here for having more or less consciously integrated into their work reflections on how to write history and thus exposed their theories as part of their writing: Hans Sedlmayr and Manfredo Tafuri. While the two historians could not be more different in their content – being Sedlmayr extremely conservative and Tafuri a progressive Marxist – the comparison of their writings and reflections, shows interesting parallels, not least because of the influence of their education as architects (which was incomplete in the case of Sedlmayr).},

The spatial features addressed include hut shape and village layout, centrally positioned livestock kraals, storage pits and burial data. The spatial features of the CCP, when applied to Early and Middle Iron Age sites, are inappropriate and mimicked by other cultures.},

The same building and speculative processes occurred in ancient Rome and cities in England and the US at greatly different periods of time but those histories do not acknowledge the similarities of development processes that each reports.

  journaltitle = {Malaysian Construction Research Journal},

  abstract = {The provision of adequate quality housing for the mass population has always been the major challenge for a rapidly developing country like Malaysia. As the country heads towards higher level of urbanization, it is expected to face accelerated demand on housing and the associated environmental impacts. Only by encouraging the development of more eficient buildings or through implementing a holistic construction approach that addressed right from the onset of the design stage, harmful environmental impact to the surroundings can be mitigated. This paper highlights the potential of applying lexibility – a design approach which has been widely adopted in the traditional construction – as an inherent design strategy for the modern urban mass housing. The proposed design strategy entails open plan that enable retroit and reconiguration to be made quickly, economically, and repeatedly, without involving excessive site labour, time, and cost; as compared to the currently adopted design strategy which is associated with rigid structure, interlocking plan, and predetermined function. It makes possible the creation of dwellings which may grow old yet without becoming obsolete; incorporating the latest design ideas and technologies, yet have a sense of history on the Malaysian housing design (the rumah kampung design); allowing the communities to live for generations, yet incorporating the potential of adaptation. By examining the background research and the fundamental design principles, the paper suggests that only dwellings with high degree of lexibility may enable the integration of dual aims and principles of affordability and sustainability in mass housing, thereby facilitating the movement of the country’s construction industry towards mechanization, industrialization, and standardization.},

  abstract = {An examination of the cultural landscape preceding the official birth of iconology provides a rich and varied picture in which diverse critical tendencies merge and diverge. Even today, the exchange of ideas during this period can provide useful insights to help clarify the discussion of critical theory. The work of Jan Białostocki, which reflects the Polish scholar's open-mindedness, breadth of interests, and attention to the necessity of reconsidering perspectives in terms of contemporary art, offers an interpretation of iconology in which the contradictions between iconology and formalism, as developed by Panofsky, are absent. Moreover, Białostocki's interpretation of iconology furnishes an opportunity to consider several themes of the iconographic method in relation to formal problems, without confusion and freed from extraneous polemics. /// Une étude du paysage culturel avant la naissance de l'iconologie fait apparaître un tableau coloré aux multiples facettes, dans lequel les différents courants de la critique se rassemblent -- et divergent. Même aujourd'hui l'échange d'idées qui s'est produit à cette époque peut fournir des aperçus utiles pour aider à éclairer la discussion sur les théories critiques. L'oeuvre de Jan Białostocki reflète l'ouverture d'esprit de l'universitaire polonais, le large champ de ses intérêts et le soin nouveau qu'il a mis à choisir ses perspectives du point de vue de l'art contemporain. Il propose une interprétation de l'iconologie dans laquelle disparaissent les contradictions soulignées par Panofsky entre iconologie et formalisme. Plus encore, l'interprétation que Białostocki donne de l'iconologie permet de mettre différents thèmes de la méthode iconographique en relation avec des problèmes formels sans tomber dans la confusion et les polémiques étrangères au sujet. /// Eine Untersuchung der kulturellen Landschaft vor der Entstehung der Ikonologie liefert uns ein facettenreiches, buntes Bild, wobei unterschiedliche kritische Strömungen verschmelzen und auseinanderlaufen. Noch heute kann der Austausch von Ideen dieser Periode nützliche Einsichten bei der Klärung der Diskussion der kritischen Theorie liefern. Białostockis Werk reflektiert seine Aufgeschlossenheit, sein breites Interesse und seine Einsicht gegenüber der Notwendigkeit, Perspektiven vom Standpunkt der Gegenwartskunst neu zu überdenken. Seine Interpretation von Ikonologie weist nicht die bei Panofsky entwickelten Widersprüche zwischen Ikonologie und Formalismus auf. Außerdem ermöglicht uns Białostockis Interpretation von Ikonologie mehrere Themen der ikonographischen Methode im Hinblick auf formale Probleme in Ruhe und frei von fremder Polemik zu betrachten.},

First, how does one make architectural history less Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of architecture without reducing architecture to politics?},

  abstract = {On the definitive return of the pope to Rome in 1420, following the so-called Avignonese captivity, the city underwent major modifications. The ‘romanam curiam sequentes’, the court and administration that followed the traditionally itinerant pope, settled in the city, leading to Rome's population doubling in the space of a few years. Furthermore, with the support of the pope, the members of the curia came to take possession of spaces, offices, roles and rituals that had previously been the reserve of the local Romans. This article considers the reaction of the community of the local nobility (here described summarily as Roman families) to the encroaching presence of the curia within the specific context of the development of the built form of the via Papalis. It is argued that the via Papalis, one of the most important and prestigious streets in Rome, became the theatre within which these two communities played out their conflict through the medium of built and ephemeral architecture.},

The paper argues that Ambrogio's dancers, through their appeal to the viewer's subjective experience, mask a youthful vitality, which may be taken as a measure of the desire for commonwealth, not just as a political abstraction but also as a living reality.},

The notion of the "divine" artist became attached to Michelangelo in particular, and Rosso and others reacted in certain works that questioned the legitimacy of his enterprise.

  abstract = {Annotation The discipline of architecture depends on the transmission in space and time of accumulated experiences, concepts, rules, and models. From the invention of the alphabet to the development of ASCII code for electronic communication, the process of recording and transmitting this body of knowledge has reflected the dominant information technologies of each period. In this book Mario Carpo discusses the communications media used by Western architects, from classical antiquity to modern classicism, showing how each medium related to specific forms of architectural thinking. Carpo highlights the significance of the invention of movable type and mechanically reproduced images. He argues that Renaissance architectural theory, particularly the system of the five architectural orders, was consciously developed in response to the formats and potential of the new printed media. Carpo contrasts architecture in the age of printing with what preceded it: Vitruvian theory and the manuscript format, oral transmission in the Middle Ages, and the fifteenth-century transition from script to print. He also suggests that the basic principles of "typographic" architecture thrived in the Western world as long as print remained our main information technology. The shift from printed to digital representations, he points out, will again alter the course of architecture.},

This article is concerned with one such use he made of the materials in the Vite by Giorgio Vasari, one volume of which we know he possessed and on which he made notes. It is suggested that this text gave him an opportunity to construct a critical vocabulary for architecture, different in character from that available to him from such sources as Palladio, Vitruvius, or Serlio. And it is also suggested that this new vocabulary is specifically reflected in two passages about architecture, and in what J. A. Gotch called Jones' sentiments about architecture, written in the notebook now at Chatsworth. In addition, this article is concerned with the development of a more general vocabulary in England in the seventeenth century, for gentlemen and architects alike, that came from the tradition of praise, or epideixis, together with terms of a more particular kind to refer to the parts of architecture that came both from Italian and French.},

cultural e artística que caracterizou o reinado de D. João III (a arte de Gregório
Lopes, por exemplo) e os anos de regência de D. Catarina em que o italianismo
se acentua, até aos alvores do domínio filipino, durante o qual a produção
pictórica evoluiria para uma pittura senza tempo, pautada pelos rigores do decoro
tridentino.
Ao estabelecer rupturas com os paradigmas tradicionais, Francisco de
Campos foi capaz de se libertar dos estiolantes constrangimentos que impunham
limitações aos artistas da geração anterior, gerando uma obra que assumiu um
papel de referência no contexto do Maneirismo internacional. A sua pintura
participa da essência maneirista dominante na Europa, demarcando-se do
mimetismo formal que caracterizava os artistas coetâneos nacionais, revelando
uma total compreensão do fenómeno criativo que o mesmo supõe e produzindo
uma obra tão original quanto moderna, que faz eco da dimensão sócio-cultural de
um tempo de mudança. Nela se pressente uma agitação íntima, que a perpassa
como um murmúreo, numa busca permanente de uma ideia de beleza universal
que lhe confere o sentido de “graça”, parecendo dar resposta à sua necessidade
formal de resolver a contradição íntima entre o sentimento lírico pessoal, que
procura na forma uma comunhão sensível, e a distância própria que impõe a
imagem litúrgica, de acordo com a tradição flamenga, da qual ele é herdeiro. Ora
o virtuosismo de Campos - como vemos na belíssima Epifania da Sé de Évora -
consiste precisamente em encontrar também no mundo litúrgico matéria de
lirismo pessoal, implicando as suas figuras a tomada de consciência de uma
realidade mais natural e humana, que interpela a sensibilidade pessoal do espectador.},

Victor Deupi explores why a powerful nation like Spain would temper its own building traditions with the more cosmopolitan trends associated with Rome; often at the expense of its own national and regional traditions. Through the inclusion of previously unpublished documents and images that shed light on the theoretical debates which shaped eighteenth-century architecture in Rome and Madrid, Architectural Temperance provides an insight into 18th century Spanish architecture in English"--},

  abstract = {Este trabalho pretende ser um estudo preliminar sobre a caracterização da paleta de Diogo de Torres, pintor maneirista, cujas pinturas forma intervencionadas recentemente. Para tal foram analisados os materiais constituintes das camadas cromáticas, presentes nas quatro pinturas retabulares do século XVI de Diogo de Torres Vedras e expostas na Igreja de S. Pedro em Dois Portos, bem como a sua técnica artística. Verificou-se a existência de uma preparação à base de gesso e a utilização de pigmentos comuns à época, como o branco de chumbo, goetite, terra de sombra, vermelhão, mínio, azurite, azul de esmalte, carvão e corante vermelho cochonilha nas quatro pinturas, através da análise por microscopia óptica, μ-EDXRF, μ-Raman, μ-FTIR, HPLC-DAD e μ-EDX-SEM. Foi identificado por μ-FTIR, a presença de aglutinante oleoso em todos os estratos analisados.
Foi ainda iniciado um projecto para o estudo da descoloração do azul esmalte, um dos pigmentos utilizados pelo artista. Este estudo teve como motivação a descoloração total das partículas de azul de esmalte, observada em todas as amostras analisadas das pinturas de Diogo de Torres. Com o intuito de compreender qual ou quais as causas e tendo presente dois factores que podem afectar a descoloração das partículas, a humidade relativa e o envelhecimento do óleo, estas amostras reais do séc. XVI foram analisadas por microscopia óptica, EDX-SEM e μ-FTIR e comparadas com amostras sintetizadas e reconstruções de camadas cromáticas de composição semelhante. A exposição durante quatro meses a 80\% de humidade relativa das reconstruções cromáticas não revelou degradação do pigmento, apresentando apenas, por exame de colorímetria, alteração da cor nas superfícies para valores mais amarelos, originados pelo óleo. Foi ainda analisado o pigmento antes e após ensaios de imersão, verificando-se uma variação de pH consistente com a sua degradação.},

  abstract = {Cofounders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, Duany and coauthor Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk are among the leading figures in the movement to end suburban sprawl and revitalize decaying inner cities by adapting and applying traditional, premodernist city planning techniques. In 2000, they wrote Suburban Nation to promote their brand of "new urbanism" to the general public. With their new book, they and town planner Robert Alminana address a professional audience of planners, architects, and policymakers, who they believe need to look beyond current zoning codes and automobile-centered design and find inspirational guidance from past centuries and diverse cultures. The book is a voluminous, richly illustrated catalog of what the authors consider to be examples of sound planning. More than 1000 briefly annotated drawings, photos, plans, and models of everything from the Acropolis to Chinese villages to Los Angeles courtyard houses provide object lessons in mixed-use design, pedestrian-friendly environments, welcoming public spaces, and other tenets of new urbanism. With more than 500 new urbanist developments completed or underway in the United States, this book is recommended for special collections serving those directly involved in city and suburban planning.-David Soltesz, Cuyahoga Cty.

They affect the way a play, painting or statue is viewed, the media, genres and arts involved, and the characters on stage or represented in painting or sculpture. These interactions raise questions about the ways genres are distinguished and defined, and ultimately the relation between representation and presence. This book offers the first systematic investigation of exchanges between the arts, architecture and the theatre, and not just an overview of the influence of the theatre on the arts, and vice versa. The authors take as their starting point a study of the implications of the use of four elements that define early modern theatre: the scenario, the actor, the theatrical space, and the audience. In doing so, the authors open up new ways of analyzing theatricality both in the arts, architecture and the theatre. They also present many new, hitherto unknown instances of the interaction between the arts, and provide these interactions with a theoretical and historiographical context"--},

So far, economic and political factors have been emphasized to explain the spatial differentiation of these communities. Though the importance of these factors is recognized a cultural dimension is added and its impact analyzed. It is argued that Malays and Chinese differ in their cultural values concerning space. Whereas the Malay conception of space is centrifocal, the Chinese conception of space is bounded. The consistency of this cultural pattern is demonstrated by drawing examples from conceptions of geographical, social, religious and political space and their combination in an image of the city. As Malaysian towns and housing developments are built according to a Chinese conception of space, the absorption of Malay rural-urban migrants is impeded and Chinese Control over urban commercial activities is maintained. Es ist nicht das Bewusstsein der Menschen, das ihr Sein, sondern umgekehrt ihr gesellschaftliches Sein, das ihr Bewusstsein bestimmt.},

  abstract = {Public spaces have been long recognized as integral parts of urban settings, often granted importance by the public ceremonies and spectacles that they hosted. Interpretations of such public arenas often focus on elites that use them to construct and legitimize power and authority; city residents are thought to either accept these political machinations, or reject them and the space itself. Alternately, studies of public space that emphasize more practical uses, such as for production or other domestic activities tend to focus on those spaces directly associated with houses, emphasizing the everyday life of city residents. This paper works to set aside this dichotomy by exploring the multi-faceted open spaces at Songo Mnara, a medieval Swahili town on the southern Tanzanian coast. Songo Mnara is particularly well-suited to a study of Swahili public space because of its short occupation and clear town plan understood through standing architecture; it is likely the best example of how the southern Swahili understood a planned town should be organized in the fifteenth century AD. Archaeological research directed at the site’s open spaces has revealed a variety of public spaces which include a mix of deliberately-maintained areas reflecting some element of control and planning, and other less formal public spaces that seem to have been organized and maintained by non-elite residents of the town. This essay reviews literature on the archaeology of open and public space and explores how the case of Songo Mnara contributes to it, by walking the reader through what has been learned about the complex and variable public spaces of the town. The public spaces of Songo Mnara serve to broaden previous dichotomous approaches to urban open space.},

Cette formule alarmiste et percutante, comme les affectionnait l’auteur, est emblématique du combat récurrent, qui motive toute son œuvre publiée, contre la dissociation de la triade, solidité, convenance, beauté, qui fondait la théorie de l’architecture depuis la Renaissance. Les titres des deux livres suivants, De l'impuissance des mathématiques pour assurer la solidité des bâtimens (1805)3, puis, De la solidité des bâtimens, puisée dans les proportions des ordres d'architecture (1806)4, font aujourd’hui figure de pure provocation, tant il est vrai que nous regardons comme une évidence que l’art de bâtir relève des techniques et des sciences de l’ingénieur et qu’il repose sur une connaissance expérimentale de la résistance des matériaux et sur des modèles mathématiques qui permettent de calculer la capacité des structures, non sur une maîtrise exemplaire du vocabulaire classique et du système des ordres. Pour autant, l’engagement réactionnaire de celui qui fut l’un des bâtisseurs les plus reconnus de son temps témoigne bien de la fin d’une époque. Elle s’oppose à l’instauration d’une approche autonome de la question de la solidité, fondée sur une compétence spécifique et qui coïncide avec l’émergence de la figure de l’ingénieu [...]},

It studies early modern science and technology, Baroque court culture, and~the development of the discipline of architecture.},

This collection shifts attention away from the elite and monumental architectural traditions of the region to instead investigate the creativity, subtlety and variability of common architecture and the people who built and dwelled in them. At the heart of this study of vernacular architecture is an emphasis on ordinary people and their built environments, and how these everyday spaces were pivotal in the making and meaning of social and cultural dynamics. Providing a deeper and more nuanced temporal perspective of common buildings in the Americas, the editors have deftly framed a study that highlights sociocultural diversity while at the same time facilitating broader comparative conversations around the theme of vernacular architecture. With diverse case studies covering a broad range of periods and regions, Vernacular Architecture in the Pre-Columbian Americas is an important addition to the growing body of scholarship on the indigenous architecture of the Americas and is a key contribution to our archaeological understandings of past built environments.},

  abstract = {In eighteenth-century France, the influential architect and historian Julien-David Leroy studied ancient monuments through two different methods-what he called the "historical" and the "architectural." These two approaches had distinctly different intended audiences, methods, and goals. His historical method was a traditional humanistic approach to the ancient monuments that studied a building's architecture in relation to its specific historic context. His architectural method, consistent with scientific practice, considered the relations among numerous similar monuments as a means of revealing underlying universal laws. In the eighteenth century, history and science both promised enlightenment, but the exact shape of that new knowledge and its implications for the present varied tremendously. Through a comparative analysis of his two methods, and of their development, interaction, and significance, this paper assesses the exact shape of Leroy's dualistic thought, and its implications for architectural practice, history and theory.},

At about the same time the celebrated painter Domenichino did the same. In that year Domenichino also unveiled The Last Communion of Saint Jerome, which was clearly a repetition of an earlier work by his master, Agostino Carracci. Although Giovanni Lanfranco, Domenichino's rival, dismissed the painting as a theft, the larger Roman art community did not quite agree. This paper examines artistic influence and production in an age before anxiety and outlines an aesthetic of repetition in an age before originality.},

  abstract = {The Majapahit Empire was a Javanese Hindu-Buddhist thalassocratic empire in Southeast Asia, based on the island of Java (part of modern-day Indonesia), that existed from 1293 to circa 1517. Majapahit reached its peak of glory during the era of Hayam Wuruk, whose reign from 1350 to 1389 was marked by conquest which extended through Southeast Asia. His achievement is also credited to his prime minister, Gajah Mada. According to the Nagarakretagama (Desawarñana) written in 1365, Majapahit was an empire of 98 tributaries, stretching from Sumatra to New Guinea; consisting of present-day Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, southern Thailand, East Timor, Sulu Archipelago and other parts of the Philippines, although the true nature of Majapahit sphere of influence is still the subject of studies among historians.Majapahit was one of the last major Hindu empires of the region and is considered to be one of the greatest and most powerful empires in the history of Indonesia and Southeast Asia, one that is sometimes seen as the precedent for Indonesia's modern boundaries. Its influence extended beyond the modern territory of Indonesia and has been the subject of many studies.},

  abstract = {The Malacca Sultanate (Malay: Kesultanan Melayu Melaka; Jawi script: کسلطانن ملايو ملاک) was a Malay sultanate centred in the modern-day state of Malacca, Malaysia. Conventional historical thesis marks c. 1400 as the founding year of the sultanate by a Malay Raja of Singapura (King of Singapore), Parameswara, also known as Iskandar Shah. 
At the height of the sultanate's power in the 15th century, its capital grew into one of the most important entrepôts of its time, with territory covering much of the Malay Peninsula, the Riau Islands and a significant portion of the northern coast of Sumatra in present-day Indonesia.As a bustling international trading port, Malacca emerged as a centre for Islamic learning and dissemination, and encouraged the development of the Malay language, literature and arts. It heralded the golden age of Malay sultanates in the archipelago, in which Classical Malay became the lingua franca of the Maritime Southeast Asia and Jawi script became the primary medium for cultural, religious and intellectual exchange. It is through these intellectual, spiritual and cultural developments, the Malaccan era witnessed the enculturation of a Malay identity, the Malayisation of the region and the subsequent formation of an Alam Melayu.In the year of 1511, the capital of Malacca fell to the Portuguese Empire, forcing the last Sultan, Mahmud Shah (r. 1488–1511), to retreat to the further reaches of his empire, where his progeny established new ruling dynasties, Johor and Perak. The political and cultural legacy of the sultanate remains to this day. For centuries, Malacca has been held up as an exemplar of Malay-Muslim civilisation. It established systems of trade, diplomacy, and governance that persisted well into the 19th century, and introduced concepts such as daulat – a distinctly Malay notion of sovereignty – that continues to shape contemporary understanding of Malay kingship. The fall of Malacca benefited Brunei when its ports became a new entrepôt as the kingdom emerged as a new Muslim empire in the Malay Archipelago, attracting many Muslim traders who fled from the Portuguese occupation after the ruler of Brunei's conversion to Islam.},

  abstract = {To date Rudolf Wittkower's Architectural Principles in the Age of Humanism of 1949 remains a fundamental evaluation of Renaissance architectural aesthetics. Although not unique in having achieved such paradigmatic status within its discipline, its simultaneous impact upon architectural production remains unprecedented. It is precisely the fact that this work captured the imagination of two traditionally distinct groups at a moment in history when exchanges between the two seemed least likely to occur that constitutes the starting point for this inquiry. Based upon an examination of Principles against the Renaissance literature it so categorically supplanted, against its art historical and broader intellectual context, as well as against contemporary architectural theory, the argument presented here proposes a deeper cultural continuity between the discourse of modernist architecture in the 1940s and 1950s and the readings of history that were conceived at the same time. In conclusion it is argued that beyond affording specific insight into the historicity of our constructions of the Renaissance, such a pattern of exchange between history writing and criticism/theory alerts us to the complex symbiosis that existed between these two reflective activities at the very heart of modernism itself.},

  abstract = {A parametric shape grammar of the traditional Malay houses (TMH) built in the past century is presented. The grammar, which consists of rules for generating the form and structure of TMH, is derived from simple geometric representations of the houses. The rules first derive the basic unit structures that form the shapes of the TMH. Nine basic shapes have been identified that form the main vocabulary elements of the grammar. Parameterized polygons and lines define each basic shape. Ranges of values assigned to the variables describing the parameterized polygons and lines are presented. The shape addition rules are used to characterize the compositional aspects of TMH style. Evidences of these basic shapes or their combinations have been documented by previous researchers and are used as a way of explaining the built forms of the TMH. The scope of the study is currently limited to the original TMH of the bumbung panjang (long roof) type in which the key features of the houses are easily discernible from the side view.},

In what was somewhat unusual for him, he invested his theoretical ideas with the substance of example in what turned out to certainly be quite a multi-facetted career. His most well meaning critics called for him to provide more concrete examples, and among other things, this book stands out for that reason. Among the art historians in the University of Vienna at that time monographic studies were also out of the ordinary.},

  abstract = {Construction of the Cathedral or Duomo of S. Maria del Fiore began in Florence in 1293/94, reached the stage of rising masonry by 1296, and had progressed so well by 1300 that the Florentine city council authorized a lifetime tax exemption for its founding architect, Arnolfo di Cambio. But at some moment after this auspicious start ill-fortune intervened: by 1310 Arnolfo was dead and work on his project suspended. Refounded as a new project in a series of committee decisions in the years 1357-1368, Florence Cathedral is generally regarded as anonymous or collective in authorship. Its fame rests not on Arnolfo's abandoned and unrecorded project but on the prodigious cupola erected by Filippo Brunelleschi from 1420 to 1436, Europe's first major dome since antiquity and chief harbinger of the Italian Renaissance. In 1978 the author presented excavation results that questioned the Brunelleschi-centered tradition and reinforced instead a persistent counter-tradition which attributes the basic features of the 1368 plan and of Brunelleschi's cupola to Arnolfo's original project of ca. 1293-1296. That preliminary hypothesis in favor of Arnolfo as conceptual author of Florence Cathedral is now strengthened by the results of a second Duomo excavation in 1980. The new findings, together with a reappraisal of the documentary evidence and a set of reconstruction drawings, are submitted here as a second and longer look at the project that changed the course of European architecture.},

  abstract = {Since Alberti, and most critically since Wittkower’s Architectural Principles, architectural theory has tended to construe ‘proportions’ in plenary, static terms. The dimension of time and change that relentlessly affects all human endeavor is not accommodated by the celebrated Albertian ideal of immutable design perfection, so perfect in all respects that once attained ‘nothing can be added, taken away, or altered, but for the worse’. This article, drawing on the author’s recent book, Building-in-Time from Giotto to Alberti and Modern Oblivion (Yale, 2010), outlines the antithetical, dynamic proportional methodology of the pre-Albertian architectural regime. Its point of departure was the author’s concept of durational aesthetics, according to which perfected architectural form is produced by a process of incessant revision. What distinguished this process from related ancient or neo-antique doctrines was above all its dynamic modality and participation in the fluid orientation and processes of ‘building-in-time’.},

However, when we look closely at the structure of De re aedificatoria and the way in which Alberti orders and presents his material, Vitruvius can no longer be considered as the main model for Alberti. De re aedificatoria contains a number of quite precise statements about its structure and order of presentation. A close reading of these passages and a comparison with classical and medieval discussions of method in the liberal and productive arts show that the structure of De re aedificatoria is not based on that of De architectura; rather it is in line with classical methods of rhetoric which originated in Plato's Phaedrus and Aristotle's Metaphysics.},

René Ouvrard, in his significant work concerning this subject, "Architecture harmonique, ou Application de la Doctrine des Proportions à l'Architecture" (Paris, 1679), attempts to prove (like Vitruv and later Alberti) that music works like architecture, both being based upon the same kind of fundamental proportions. These proportions are also proof of a divine harmony because as architecture, and music both follow human proportions, these arts are therefore imitative of the perfection given by God when He created the human form. The treatise of Ouvrard was also included in the "Cours d'architecture" of Blondel as part of the "Quarell of Ancients and Modernes"; the opposing view was represented by Perrault in "Parallèle". The theory of Ouvrard works with a rhetorical figure: the epephonical object. Using architecture in one way and music in the other way (it depends upon the first point of view), Ouvrard concludes that if these arts are to function in the same way, they must follow the principles edicted to them in Antiquity.},

  abstract = {A Pequena Era Glacial (Pequena Idade do Gelo, em português Europeu) foi um período de resfriamento que ocorreu na Era Moderna. Os climatologistas não estão de acordo sobre as datas de início e fim deste período. Alguns defendem que teria iniciado no século XVI e terminado na primeira metade do século XIX, enquanto outros sugerem que foi em um período do século XIII ao XVII. Teria sido nos anos de 1650, 1770 e 1850 que ocorreram os mínimos de temperatura, cada um separado por intervalos ligeiramente mais quentes [1]. O período mais frio da Pequena Era Glacial parece estar relacionado com uma profunda queda nas tempestades solares conhecida como Mínimo de Maunder. 
Foi no século XVII, devido à Pequena Era Glacial, que os viquingues abandonaram a Groenlândia, cuja vegetação passou de verdejante a tundra. A Finlândia perdeu então um terço da sua população e a Islândia metade. Na Inglaterra, o Tâmisa congelou (pela primeira vez em 1607, pela última em 1814). No inverno de 1780, a zona fluvial de Nova Iorque congelou e podia-se ir a pé da ilha de Manhattan à de Staten Island, tendo as conexões comerciais bloqueadas por via marítima. Os canais holandeses costumavam ficar completamente congelados. As geleiras nos Alpes cobriam aldeias inteiras, matando milhares de pessoas, e se formou uma grande quantidade de gelo no mar, a tal ponto que não existia mar aberto em torno da Islândia em 1695.

Alguns investigadores acreditam que o atual aquecimento do planeta corresponde a um período de recuperação após a Pequena Era Glacial e que a atividade humana não é um fator decisivo para a atual tendência de aumento da temperatura global. No entanto, esta tese tem oposição dos ambientalistas em razão da grande proporção da elevação da temperatura nas recentes décadas após a Revolução Industrial.},

Here assemblages from coastal towns and from surface survey in the interior are used to paint a different picture of urban (Swahili) origins. The author shows that coast and interior shared a common culture, but that coastal sites grew into ‘stonetowns’ thanks to the social impact of imports: the material culture structured the society.},

  abstract = {Houses are an important subject of archaeological research, normally explored through the households they contain. This has established a deliberately social agenda for the archaeology of houses, yet has had the unintended consequence of creating bounded worlds for study. Although household archaeologies explore the ways that households contributed to broader social and economic realms, it is rare to think through the public role of houses for non-residents and the larger population of the settlement. This paper seeks to explore this more public aspect of houses using the data from archaeology at Songo Mnara, a 14th–15th century Swahili town on the southern Tanzanian coast. This was a time when stone-built domestic architecture was first emerging in this region. The archaeology of the houses provides data for a series of ways that the house was at the heart of the economic and political life of the town, as well as demonstrating a spatial continuity between indoor and outdoor spaces. It is therefore suggested that the domestic and residential functions of the house for a particular household should be balanced with an appreciation of the broader world of the house itself.},

With the death of Janet Lippman Abu-Lughod (b. 1928) last Saturday, the best of academic learning has suffered another blow. Her passing joins the recent loss of her New School colleagues Eric Hobsbawm, Aristide Zolberg and Charles Tilly. Each in his way enriched the historically oriented social study of the modern world. Among them, known for their dedication to intellectual excellence, as well as versatility and originality, Abu-Lughod distinguished herself as a very rare scholar who could range across centuries and continents, from the thirteenth century to the current moment, from the North Africa and the Middle East to Central Asia and North America. She was to the end a Chicago School urbanist whose methodological approach combined a unique ability to expand its scope into comparative studies that brought a needed political dimension. Upon her arrival to the New School for Social Research in 1987, she had already achieved a phenomenal output of well over a hundred articles and more than thirteen books......Read More},
